# Sentiment Analysis

For this project, we conducted sentiment analysis on homework review data. By running different sentiment analysis processes on our input data, we were able to analyze subjective characteristics of our input data and extrapolate further information that can be used to draw conclusions and improve the course.

## Motivation for Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a way to analyze the mood or emotion in a large collection of text documents. Sentiment analysis is a particularly powerful tool to use because it combines natural language processing and data analysis. By using sentiment analysis on our input data, we are able to extract qualities of our input data and then display those qualities in visual formats like graphs and charts. For our homework reviews data, we are able to break down our results even further by things like homework, topic, or semester.  This allows us to easily filter our output based on different audiences we may have or specific problems we are trying to solve.
